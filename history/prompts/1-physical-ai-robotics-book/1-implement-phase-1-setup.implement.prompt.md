## Prompt

implement the phase 1

## Response snapshot

Completed Phase 1 tasks: Created monorepo structure and set up Spec Kit artifacts.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project initialized with basic structure and Spec Kit artifacts.
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit tests for setup tasks.
- 📁 Files: Created .gitignore, frontend/, backend/, infra/, history/prompts/, history/adr/.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to Phase 2: Foundational tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully initialized project structure and Spec Kit artifacts as per Phase 1 tasks. The PHR script was not found, so agent-native creation was used.
