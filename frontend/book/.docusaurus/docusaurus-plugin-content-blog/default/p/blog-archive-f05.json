The robot was tasked with autonomously navigating a designated course that included:\r\n-   Uneven grassy terrain with hidden depressions.\r\n-   A moderate slope with loose gravel.\r\n-   Small scattered obstacles (rocks, branches).\r\n-   Varying lighting conditions (sunny, partially cloudy).\r\n\r\n## Robot Platform and AI System\r\n\r\n-   **Robot**: A custom-built bipedal humanoid platform, approximately 1.5 meters tall, with force-sensing feet and a high degree of joint compliance.\r\n-   **Perception**: A multi-modal sensor suite comprising a 3D Lidar, stereo cameras, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to create a detailed understanding of the environment.\r\n-   **Localization**: A combination of GPS, visual odometry, and Lidar-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for accurate position estimation.\r\n-   **Path Planning**: A hierarchical planner: a global planner for high-level route generation, and a local planner that continuously adapts foot placement and body posture based on real-time terrain assessment.\r\n-   **Locomotion Control**: A whole-body control framework integrating balance control (e.g., ZMP-based) with trajectory generation, allowing for dynamic walking and obstacle avoidance.\r\n-   **Onboard Compute**: NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier for real-time sensor processing and AI inference.\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\n\r\n1.  **Environment Mapping**: Initial 3D point cloud generation using Lidar and stereo cameras to create a traversability map.\r\n2.  **AI Training (Simulation First)**: Locomotion policies were pre-trained using reinforcement learning in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, incorporating domain randomization to improve sim-to-real transfer.\r\n3.  **Real-world Deployment**: The trained policies and navigation stack were deployed onto the physical humanoid.\r\n4.  **Data Collection and Refinement**: During trials, sensor data and robot performance metrics were logged to iteratively refine perception and control algorithms.\r\n\r\n## Key Findings and Challenges\r\n\r\n-   **Perception Robustness**: The fusion of Lidar and stereo camera data proved critical for accurate terrain mapping, especially in environments with sparse features.\r\n-   **Dynamic Balance**: Maintaining balance on loose gravel and slopes required highly responsive whole-body control, often pushing the limits of the robot's torque capabilities.\r\n-   **Computational Load**: Real-time processing of high-resolution sensor data and complex planning algorithms necessitated optimized software and efficient onboard hardware.\r\n-   **Unexpected Obstacles**: Small, unmapped obstacles remained a challenge, occasionally requiring human intervention or recovery behaviors.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis experiment demonstrated the feasibility and significant challenges of deploying humanoid robots in unstructured outdoor environments. While progress is rapid, further research in robust perception, adaptive locomotion control, and real-time decision-making under uncertainty is essential to unlock the full potential of humanoids for tasks such as inspection, search and rescue, and logistics in complex terrains.\r\n\r\n![Docusaurus Plushie Banner](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\r\n*(Image: A humanoid robot carefully navigating an uneven outdoor path.)*"},{"id":"the-role-of-mdx-in-physical-ai-documentation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-role-of-mdx-in-physical-ai-documentation","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"The Role of MDX in Physical AI Documentation","description":"As Physical AI and humanoid robotics become increasingly complex, effective documentation is crucial.

This post explores how MDX, a superset of Markdown that lets you embed JSX, can significantly enhance the quality and interactivity of Physical AI documentation.\r\n\r\n:::tip\r\n\r\nMDX allows you to embed interactive React components directly into your Markdown content, making complex Physical AI concepts easier to understand and explore.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n{/* truncate */}\r\n\r\n## Beyond Static Text: Interactive Explanations\r\n\r\nTraditional Markdown is excellent for static text and code snippets. However, Physical AI often involves:\r\n-   **Dynamic Simulations**: Visualizing robot movements or sensor data in real-time.\r\n-   **Interactive Diagrams**: Explaining kinematics or control flow with manipulable graphics.\r\n-   **Live Code Examples**: Allowing users to modify and run snippets of robot programming code directly in the documentation.\r\n\r\nMDX makes this possible by allowing you to seamlessly integrate React components.\r\n\r\n## Example: An Interactive Robot Joint Controller\r\n\r\nImagine documenting a robot arm's inverse kinematics. Instead of static images and equations, you could embed a component that lets the user drag a slider to change a joint angle and immediately see the robot's posture update, or even visualize the end-effector's path.\r\n\r\n```jsx title=\"src/components/JointSlider.js\"\r\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction JointSlider({ jointName, initialValue, min, max }) {\r\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\r\n\r\n  const handleChange = (event) => {\r\n    setValue(event.target.value);\r\n    // In a real application, this would send a command to a robot model/simulator\r\n    console.log(`${jointName} set to: ${event.target.value} degrees`);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <label>{jointName}: {value}°</label>\r\n      <input\r\n        type=\"range\"\r\n        min={min}\r\n        max={max}\r\n        value={value}\r\n        onChange={handleChange}\r\n        style={{ width: '100%' }}\r\n      />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Export for use in MDX\r\nexport default JointSlider;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in your MDX blog post:\r\n\r\n```mdx\r\nimport JointSlider from '@site/src/components/JointSlider';\r\n\r\n## Control the Robot's Shoulder Joint\r\n\r\nExperiment with the shoulder joint angle below:\r\n\r\n<JointSlider jointName=\"Shoulder Yaw\" initialValue={45} min={-90} max={90} />\r\n\r\nThis interactive element helps users grasp the mechanics much faster than text alone.\r\n```\r\n*(Note: The actual `JointSlider` component would need to be created in your `src/components` directory for this example to fully function.)*\r\n\r\n## Enhancing Learning and Engagement\r\n\r\nBy making documentation interactive, MDX helps:\r\n-   **Deepen Understanding**: Users can actively experiment with concepts rather than passively reading.\r\n-   **Improve Retention**: Hands-on interaction reinforces learning.\r\n-   **Accelerate Development**: Developers can quickly test parameters and understand APIs directly from the docs.\r\n\r\nThe integration of MDX in Docusaurus provides a powerful toolkit for creating cutting-edge documentation that keeps pace with the innovations in Physical AI."},{"id":"case-study-warehouse-automation-humanoid-robots","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/case-study-warehouse-automation-humanoid-robots","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","title":"Case Study - Warehouse Automation with Humanoid Robots","description":"The logistics and warehousing industry faces increasing demands for efficiency, accuracy, and safety.
