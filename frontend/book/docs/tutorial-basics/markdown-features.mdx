# Docusaurus Features for Physical AI Documentation

Docusaurus provides powerful Markdown and MDX features that are incredibly useful for creating rich, interactive, and well-structured documentation for Physical AI and humanoid robotics projects.

## Front Matter

Leverage Front Matter to add metadata to your documentation files. This is essential for organizing content, defining titles, descriptions, and controlling sidebar behavior.

```text title="my-physical-ai-doc.md"
---
id: physical-ai-intro
title: Introduction to Physical AI
description: Core concepts and applications of Physical AI.
slug: /physical-ai/introduction
sidebar_label: 'Physical AI Intro'
sidebar_position: 1
---

# Introduction to Physical AI
This document covers the fundamental principles...
```

## Links and Cross-referencing

Effectively link between different parts of your documentation, including chapters, tutorials, and external resources. This is crucial for guiding readers through complex topics in Physical AI.

```md
Learn more about [Simulating with Gazebo](./create-a-document.md).
Refer to [NVIDIA Isaac Sim Integration](./create-a-blog-post.md) for advanced setups.
```

## Images and Media

Embed images, diagrams, and even videos to explain complex robotic concepts, hardware setups, or simulation results. Docusaurus handles image paths efficiently.

```md
![Robot Arm in Gazebo](/img/gazebo_robot_arm.png)
*(Assuming you place `gazebo_robot_arm.png` in your `static/img` directory)*
```

## Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Showcase code snippets for robot programming (Python, C++, ROS 2 commands) with syntax highlighting for readability.

````md
```python title="robot_control.py"
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

class RobotController(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('robot_controller')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(Twist, '/cmd_vel', 10)
        # ...
```
````

## Admonitions (Info, Warning, Danger)

Use Docusaurus admonitions to highlight important tips, warnings, or crucial information related to Physical AI development, such as safety protocols or common pitfalls in simulation.

```md
:::tip Important Note on Calibration

Always calibrate your robot's sensors before running critical experiments.

:::

:::danger Safety First

Ensure all emergency stops are functional before operating physical robots.

:::
```

## MDX and React Components for Interactivity

MDX allows you to embed React components directly into your Markdown, enabling interactive diagrams, live code examples, or dynamic visualizations of robot data.

```jsx
import RobotStatusDisplay from '@site/src/components/RobotStatusDisplay';

<RobotStatusDisplay robotId="humanoid_alpha" />
```
*(Assuming `RobotStatusDisplay` is a React component you've created in `src/components`)*

This capability is invaluable for creating engaging and highly informative documentation for complex Physical AI projects.
