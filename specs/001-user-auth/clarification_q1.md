| Option | Answer                                    | Implications                                                                  |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A      | Minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. | Strong security, but potentially higher friction for users.                   |
| B      | Minimum 8 characters, including at least one letter and one number.                                              | Moderate security, good balance between security and user convenience.      |
| C      | Minimum 6 characters.                     | Lower security, easier for users, but less protection against brute-force attacks. |
