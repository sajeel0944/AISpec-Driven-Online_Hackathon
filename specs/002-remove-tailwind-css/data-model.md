# Data Model: Remove Tailwind CSS

This feature, "Remove Tailwind CSS", is purely a front-end styling migration and does not introduce any new data models or require modifications to existing ones.

Therefore, this `data-model.md` remains empty as there are no data-related aspects to document for this specific feature.
