# Feature Specification: Fix Docusaurus GitHub Pages Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `001-fix-docusaurus-deployment`
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I already have a Docusaurus site deployed on GitHub Pages using the gh-pages branch.
The deployment URL is:
https://sajeel4490.github.io/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/

Recently, I pushed some new changes to the gh-pages branch, but now the site is broken and only Markdown / README-style content is showing instead of the complete Docusaurus UI.

Your task:

Fix the GitHub Pages deployment so the full Docusaurus UI renders correctly (CSS, JS, routing, assets).

Use the existing gh-pages branch only.

Ensure the deployment URL does NOT change.

Make sure the branch contains only the correct Docusaurus build output, not source files.

Verify and fix:

baseUrl

url

GitHub Pages configuration

Build output path

Provide the exact commands or workflow changes required to rebuild and redeploy properly.

Repository branch:
https://github.com/sajeel4490/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/tree/gh-pages

The final result should be that opening the GitHub Pages link shows the complete working Docusaurus website UI, not raw markdown."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Docusaurus Site with Full UI (Priority: P1)

As a visitor to the Docusaurus site, I want to see the complete Docusaurus UI with proper styling, navigation, and interactive elements, so that I can effectively browse the documentation and have a good user experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the site - if users can't see the proper UI, the entire purpose of the documentation site is defeated.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the GitHub Pages URL and verifying that CSS, JavaScript, and routing work properly, delivering a complete Docusaurus experience instead of raw markdown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor accesses the GitHub Pages URL, **When** they load the page, **Then** they see the complete Docusaurus UI with proper styling, navigation sidebar, and interactive elements
2. **Given** a visitor navigates between different pages on the site, **When** they click on navigation links, **Then** the routing works properly and loads the correct content with the same UI styling

### User Story 2 - Maintain Existing Deployment Configuration (Priority: P2)

As a site administrator, I want to ensure that the GitHub Pages deployment URL remains unchanged and continues to use the gh-pages branch, so that existing links and bookmarks continue to work.

**Why this priority**: Maintaining the existing URL is critical for preserving SEO value and existing user bookmarks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the deployment URL remains https://sajeel4490.github.io/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/ and that it's served from the gh-pages branch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the deployment is fixed, **When** someone visits the original URL, **Then** the site loads correctly and the URL remains unchanged

---

### User Story 3 - Proper Asset Loading (Priority: P3)

As a visitor to the Docusaurus site, I want all assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) to load correctly, so that the site functions properly and looks as designed.

**Why this priority**: Without proper asset loading, the UI will be broken even if the HTML structure is correct.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by checking browser developer tools to verify that all assets load without 404 errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor loads the site, **When** the page renders, **Then** all CSS files load without errors and styling is applied correctly
2. **Given** a visitor interacts with the site, **When** JavaScript functionality is triggered, **Then** all JavaScript files load without errors and functionality works as expected

## Edge Cases

- What happens when the baseUrl is configured incorrectly for GitHub Pages subdirectory structure?
- How does the system handle missing or misconfigured build output files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST serve the complete Docusaurus UI with proper CSS styling instead of raw markdown content
- **FR-002**: System MUST load all JavaScript assets correctly to enable site interactivity
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement proper routing for navigating between documentation pages
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain the existing deployment URL: https://sajeel4490.github.io/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/
- **FR-005**: System MUST use only the gh-pages branch for deployment
- **FR-006**: System MUST contain only the correct Docusaurus build output (not source files) in the gh-pages branch
- **FR-007**: System MUST have correct baseUrl configuration for GitHub Pages subdirectory structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST have correct url configuration matching the GitHub Pages repository setup
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify GitHub Pages configuration is properly set to use the gh-pages branch
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure build output path is correctly configured for GitHub Pages deployment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Docusaurus Build Output**: The compiled static files (HTML, CSS, JS) that constitute the working website
- **GitHub Pages Configuration**: Settings that determine how GitHub serves the static content from the repository

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Visitors can access the GitHub Pages URL (https://sajeel4490.github.io/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/) and see the complete Docusaurus UI with proper styling instead of raw markdown
- **SC-002**: All CSS and JavaScript assets load without errors (verified by no 404 errors in browser console)
- **SC-003**: Navigation between pages works correctly with proper routing
- **SC-004**: The deployment URL remains unchanged from the original: https://sajeel4490.github.io/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/
- **SC-005**: The gh-pages branch contains only the correct Docusaurus build output, not source files
