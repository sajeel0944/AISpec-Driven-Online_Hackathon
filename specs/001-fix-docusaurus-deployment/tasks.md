# Implementation Tasks: Fix Docusaurus GitHub Pages Deployment

**Feature**: 001-fix-docusaurus-deployment
**Generated**: 2025-12-15
**Spec**: specs/001-fix-docusaurus-deployment/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/001-fix-docusaurus-deployment/plan.md

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows a phased approach to fix the Docusaurus GitHub Pages deployment:

- **MVP Scope**: Update GitHub Actions workflow to properly deploy from frontend/ directory (US1 - P1)
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story builds on the previous, ensuring the site renders properly
- **Independent Testing**: Each user story can be verified independently
- **Parallel Execution**: Where possible, tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (P1) must be completed before US2 and US3
- US2 and US3 can be executed in parallel after US1 completion
- All require the GitHub Actions workflow to be properly configured

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **US1**: Update workflow + verify config simultaneously [P]
- **US2**: Verify URL + check branch usage simultaneously [P]
- **US3**: Test CSS + JS loading simultaneously [P]

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### Goal
Prepare the environment and verify current state before making changes.

- [x] T001 Verify current repository structure and identify Docusaurus source location
- [x] T002 Check current state of gh-pages branch content
- [x] T003 Review existing GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- [x] T004 Verify Docusaurus configuration in frontend/docusaurus.config.ts

## Phase 2: Foundational

### Goal
Establish the correct foundation for deployment by fixing the GitHub Actions workflow.

- [x] T005 Update GitHub Actions workflow to reference frontend/ directory instead of book/
- [x] T006 Modify cache dependency path from book/package-lock.json to frontend/package-lock.json
- [x] T007 Change build directory from cd book to cd frontend in workflow
- [x] T008 Update artifact path from book/build to frontend/build in workflow
- [x] T009 Adjust workflow trigger to ensure it works with the intended branch strategy

## Phase 3: [US1] Access Docusaurus Site with Full UI

### Goal
Ensure the complete Docusaurus UI renders correctly with proper styling, navigation, and interactive elements.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by visiting the GitHub Pages URL and verifying that CSS, JavaScript, and routing work properly, delivering a complete Docusaurus experience instead of raw markdown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given a visitor accesses the GitHub Pages URL, when they load the page, then they see the complete Docusaurus UI with proper styling, navigation sidebar, and interactive elements
2. Given a visitor navigates between different pages on the site, when they click on navigation links, then the routing works properly and loads the correct content with the same UI styling

- [x] T010 [US1] Build the Docusaurus site locally to verify it works correctly: cd frontend && npm run build
- [x] T011 [US1] Verify the build output in frontend/build/ directory has proper HTML structure
- [x] T012 [US1] Test the built site locally using serve: cd frontend && npx serve -s build
- [x] T013 [US1] Commit and push updated workflow to trigger deployment
- [x] T014 [US1] Monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution and verify successful build
- [x] T015 [US1] Verify the deployed site shows proper Docusaurus UI instead of raw markdown

## Phase 4: [US2] Maintain Existing Deployment Configuration

### Goal
Ensure that the GitHub Pages deployment URL remains unchanged and continues to use the gh-pages branch.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the deployment URL remains https://sajeel4490.github.io/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/ and that it's served from the gh-pages branch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given the deployment is fixed, when someone visits the original URL, then the site loads correctly and the URL remains unchanged

- [x] T016 [US2] Verify Docusaurus config has correct URL: url: 'https://sajeel4490.github.io'
- [x] T017 [US2] Verify Docusaurus config has correct baseUrl: '/Hackathon-2025-Robotics-ai-Book1/'
- [x] T018 [US2] Confirm GitHub Pages is configured to use gh-pages branch
- [x] T019 [US2] Test that the deployment URL remains unchanged after workflow update
- [x] T020 [US2] Verify that gh-pages branch is still the deployment source

## Phase 5: [US3] Proper Asset Loading

### Goal
Ensure all assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) load correctly so the site functions properly and looks as designed.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by checking browser developer tools to verify that all assets load without 404 errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given a visitor loads the site, when the page renders, then all CSS files load without errors and styling is applied correctly
2. Given a visitor interacts with the site, when JavaScript functionality is triggered, then all JavaScript files load without errors and functionality works as expected

- [x] T021 [US3] Check browser developer tools for CSS loading errors after deployment
- [x] T022 [US3] Check browser developer tools for JavaScript loading errors after deployment
- [x] T023 [US3] Verify all static assets (images, fonts) load correctly
- [x] T024 [US3] Test interactive elements (navigation, buttons, etc.) work properly
- [x] T025 [US3] Validate that all site functionality works as expected (search, sidebar, etc.)

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Goal
Final verification and optimization of the deployment process.

- [x] T026 Verify all functional requirements from spec are met (FR-001 through FR-010)
- [x] T027 Test site performance and loading speed
- [x] T028 Validate that all success criteria are met (SC-001 through SC-005)
- [x] T029 Document the deployment process for future reference
- [x] T030 Clean up any temporary files or branches created during the process
