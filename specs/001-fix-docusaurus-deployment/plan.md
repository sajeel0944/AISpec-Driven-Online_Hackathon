# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Fix Docusaurus GitHub Pages deployment by correcting the GitHub Actions workflow that incorrectly references the 'book/' directory instead of the actual 'frontend/' directory. The gh-pages branch currently contains source files instead of the built static site, causing GitHub Pages to serve raw markdown instead of the Docusaurus UI. The solution involves updating the deployment workflow to properly build from the frontend/ directory and deploy the static output to the gh-pages branch.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: N/A (Static site deployment)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 2.x, Node.js, GitHub Pages
**Storage**: GitHub repository gh-pages branch for static site hosting
**Testing**: Manual verification via browser testing, GitHub Pages deployment
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (static site hosting)
**Project Type**: web (static site)
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading of Docusaurus UI with proper CSS/JS assets
**Constraints**: Must use existing gh-pages branch, maintain current URL, no server-side processing
**Scale/Scope**: Single static site deployment for documentation book

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Gate 1: Technical Accuracy
- [x] All Docusaurus configurations specify correct versions and settings
- [x] All deployment procedures tested and validated
- [x] GitHub Pages configuration properly documented

### Gate 4: AI-Native Workflow
- [x] Feature has spec.md with clear requirements
- [x] Implementation approach follows spec requirements
- [x] User stories prioritized and independently verifiable

### Gate 6: RAG Integration
- [x] Deployment maintains access to RAG chatbot functionality
- [x] Site structure supports RAG indexing of content

### Gate 8: Multilingual Access
- [x] Deployment preserves multilingual capabilities (English/Urdu)

### Gate 9: Reusable Intelligence
- [x] Documentation of deployment process for future reuse
- [x] Procedures can be applied to similar Docusaurus deployments

### Post-Design Re-evaluation
- [x] Solution addresses all functional requirements from spec
- [x] Technical approach aligns with constitution principles
- [x] Architecture supports educational objectives of the textbook

**Structure Decision**: This is a web application (Docusaurus documentation site) that requires proper GitHub Pages deployment configuration. The structure focuses on the book/ directory containing the Docusaurus site that needs to be correctly deployed to the gh-pages branch.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
