# Quickstart Guide: Frontend UI/UX Enhancement

This guide provides instructions for quickly setting up and running the frontend application to observe the UI/UX enhancements.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   Git

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Switch to the feature branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout 001-enhance-frontend-ui
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend/book
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Docusaurus development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in your terminal).

## Verifying UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Main Page Redesign**: Observe the main landing page (`http://localhost:3000`) for the new modern layout, typography, and spacing.
*   **Responsiveness**: Resize your browser window or view the application on different devices to verify the responsive layout.
*   **Animations/Micro-interactions**: Interact with buttons, navigation links, and scroll through pages to see hover effects, page transitions, and scroll-triggered animations.
*   **Dark Mode**: Toggle the theme to Dark Mode (usually a switch in the header or footer) and verify that the background color is a stylish dark shade (e.g., deep gray or charcoal), not pure black.

This quickstart focuses on the frontend. The backend may also need to be run for full application functionality, but it is not strictly required to observe the UI/UX changes.
