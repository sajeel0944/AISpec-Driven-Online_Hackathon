# Data Model

This feature, "Frontend UI/UX Enhancement", is primarily focused on the presentation layer of the application and does not introduce any new data models or require modifications to existing ones.

The changes are confined to:
*   Styling (CSS, Tailwind CSS configurations)
*   React component structure and presentation logic
*   Docusaurus theme and layout overrides

Therefore, this `data-model.md` remains empty as there are no data-related aspects to document for this specific feature.
